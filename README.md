### We can use any nodejs app for this project. But dependening on the project complexity additional dependencis or tools might be required. So, to follow along you can use my weather-app that is in my github repo. https://github.com/chemical081/weather-app.git

## Prequisite
- install nodejs
- npm package
- install docker 
- install jenkins 


## Objective
- When we are push a code or make any changes in our github repo, the changes must be automatically updated.
- As we can see in the image we have used various services like AWS, jenkins, docker, scripting and more. So, the idea is to make all the services run if there is a change in the github repo.
